Target your audience
====================

Getting your marketing campaigns to the *right* audience is paramount when trying to grow your
business. Fortunately, the :guilabel:`Odoo Marketing Automation` application provides you with the
right tools to take your marketing strategies to the next level.

How to work with target filters
===============================

When configuring the filters, there are some rules that have an arrow icon beside them, this
signifies that the parameter has more variables within it.

More than one parameter line can be configured. A :guilabel:`node (+)` - can be added under what is
called a :guilabel:`branch (…)`. To add a node click on the :guilabel:`+` icon and to add another
branch click on the :guilabel:`three dots icon (...)`. 

To exclude a :guilabel:`node` (or a :guilabel:`branch`), click on :guilabel:`Delete node (x)`.

Every time a new branch is created, there are two options, either the records can match
:guilabel:`all` criteria for the upcoming rules, or :guilabel:`any` (meaning one rule or the
other). To change between these two options simply click the drop down arrow icon in the green box
and select :guilabel:`Any` or :guilabel:`All`.
