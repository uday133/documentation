Bank statements
===============

Importing your bank statements in Odoo Accounting allows you to keep track of the financial
movements that occur on your bank accounts and reconcile them with the transactions recorded in your
accounting.

We recommend using :doc:`bank_synchronization` for more efficiency. However, if you do not want to
use **bank synchronization** or if your bank is not a supported institution, other options exist:

- Import the bank statement files delivered by your bank;
- Register the bank statements manually.

Import bank statements files
============================

Odoo supports multiple file formats to import bank statements:

- SEPA recommended Cash Management format (CAMT.053);
- Comma-separated values (.CSV);
- Open Financial Exchange (.OFX);
- Quicken Interchange Format (.QIF);
- Belgium: Coded Statement of Account (.CODA).

To import a file, go to :menuselection:`Accounting Dashboard --> Overview --> Bank`, click on
:guilabel:`Import Statements`, or click on the ⋮ button and then on :guilabel:`Import Statement`.

Next, select the file you want to import and click on :guilabel:`Import`.

Odoo opens an **import widget** to help you set the :guilabel:`Formatting Options` and **map** the
different columns you want to import. You also have the possibility to :guilabel:`test` the bank
statement file before uploading it to your database.

.. note::
   **Quicken Interchange Format (.QIF)** is no longer supported since 2005.

Register bank statements manually
=================================

If needed, you can also record your bank statements manually. To do so, go to
:menuselection:`Accounting Dashboard --> Overview --> Bank`, click on :guilabel:`Create Statements`,
or on the ⋮ button and then on :guilabel:`New Statement`. Add a new line for each transaction
written on the original bank statement.

To ease the reconciliation process, make sure to fill out the :guilabel:`Partner` field. You can
also type in the payments’ references in the :guilabel:`Label` field.

.. note::
   The **Ending Balance** and the **Computed Balance** should have the same amount. If it is not the
   case, make sure that there is no mistake in the transactions’ amounts.
